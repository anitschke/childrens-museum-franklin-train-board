# childrens-museum-franklin-train-board

The [Children's Museum of Franklin](https://www.childrensmuseumfranklin.org/) has a window overlooking the overlooks the MBTA Franklin commuter rail line. Whenever a train goes by kids will rush over to the window to watch it. This is a project for a train arrival board that shows when the next train will be arriving and plays an animation of a train when it is about to pass by.

xxx add recording of display

xxx you can press button to trigger train to go by. You must press and hold button until the train starts passing by.


## Hardware

Adafruit makes it super easy to create an internet connected LED board like this. They sell a ESP32-S3 based board that integrates with HUB-75 based LED boards. Plug it in, write some python code, and just move it onto the board as if it was a USB drive.

## Maxtrix Portal Setup

### Flash with CircuitPython

The [instructions on setting up the Matrix Portal S3](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-s3/install-circuitpython) that state you can just drag and drop the circuit python `.u2` file onto the `MATRXS3BOOT` drive don't seem to work correctly. However I was able to install it using the web installer on
* https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_matrixportal_s3/
* "Open Installer"
* "Install CircuitPython 10.0.0 UF2 Only"
* Continue following install instructions

Currently using `adafruit-circuitpython-matrixportal_m4-en_US-10.0.0`

### Install Adafruit Library

After setting up CircuitPython we need to install the Adafruit python libraries onto the device. This can be done by running the `install_circuitpython_lib.sh` script. This script installs EVERYTHING from that python bundle. There is a lot more than we need in that lib, but it is only 1MB so it isn't too bad to just include it all. At one pint I set up something to reduce the size and only install what I needed but the way I was doing it seemed to be fragile and I now that I am not logging to the file system I didn't need the extra space so decided to just get rid of that code. See [12639a7](https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board/commit/12639a794d5604a41d5e1b3bb21851ef8ebe4f4a).

### `settings.toml`

A `settings.toml` must be created inside this directory containing secrets and API keys. It will be copied over to the device when `install.sh` is run in the next step.

* `CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID` and `CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD` need to contain the wifi SSID and password so the board can connect to wifi
* `CIRCUITPY_WEB_API_PORT` and `CIRCUITPY_WEB_API_PASSWORD` may be set to enable access to the board over wifi, this is generally not recommended for security reasons.
* `ADAFRUIT_AIO_USERNAME` and `ADAFRUIT_AIO_KEY` are required so it can push logs to the adafruit.io log feed and connect to the adafruit.io NTP time server so it can fetch the current time. A free account can be created at io.adafruit.com .
* `MBTA_API_KEY` a free MBTA API key is required to avoid rate limiting issues and to ensure version compatibility of the API. See https://api-v3.mbta.com/ .  

```toml
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID = "REDACTED"
CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD = "REDACTED"

ADAFRUIT_AIO_USERNAME = "REDACTED"
ADAFRUIT_AIO_KEY      = "REDACTED"

MBTA_API_KEY = "REDACTED"
```
### Install the program

Run `install.sh` to install all of software and dependencies like the sprite sheet for the animation of the train onto the board.


## Notes

### Request a train

You can request that the train animation can play but holding down either the up or down buttons on the board when right when then "Children's Museum of Franklin" scrolling text disappears.

### Running tests

Unit tests can be run with Python by running the following at the root of the repository. Currently I am using Python 3.13.7 on Linux for testing.

```sh
python -m unittest discover -p "*_test.py"
```

### Logs

Logs for the board are pushed to [adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/anitschke/feeds/cmf-train-board-logging).


### Implementation complexity

The [Adafruit Matrix Portal library ](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MatrixPortal) is setup to make this sort of LED board **very** easy if all you want do to is fetch some data from an API and display it on the board. My first prototype used this much simpler approach that is provided by the library. You just give the library a URL to query and a function to post process the data from that URL and it will pipe that into some text fields and automatically update every few seconds. This implementation can be found way back in the old commit [42d4df9](https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board/blob/42d4df91104091cb4706397605a01e57b116b2f3/code.py). 

The final implementation of this board ended up being a lot more complicated than this first prototype few reasons:
* The board is intended to be at a children's museum where a lot of kids are young and haven't learned how to read yet. So I wanted some sort of animation that small kids would be able to use too. The library didn't seem to have a good way to build this sort of need to play an animation into its text update cycle.
* The MBTA API doesn't have a way to query for an estimated arrival time any arbitrary location on the track, only for estimated arrival times a stations. Since the Children's Museum of Franklin a few minutes down the track from the Franklin station I needed to apply a offset to the time provided by the MBTA API. This gets a little complicated and I wanted to be able to add unit tests for this logic. So I split it off into its own separate file/class.

If you are going to make a board like this I would recommend you first go with the easy approach in commit 
[42d4df9](https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board/blob/42d4df91104091cb4706397605a01e57b116b2f3/code.py) and only move on to something more complicated like this if you need extra functionality.

### Computing arrival time offsets

The MBTA API doesn't have a way to query for an estimated arrival time any arbitrary location on the track, only for estimated arrival times a stations. Since the Children's Museum of Franklin a few minutes down the track from the Franklin station I needed to apply a offset to the time provided by the MBTA API. To figure out what offset to apply to the time provided by the MBTA API I recorded a predicted times vs when the train passed by the Children's Museum of Franklin. This analysis can be found in this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board-data-analysis .

### Train sprite

I made a simple script using ImageMagick to help build a sprite sheet of a train animation to play when the train is about to pass by. The script for building this sprite sheet can be found in this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board-train-sprite .

### Testing

### dependency injection

Rather than directly import Adafruit Python libraries many of the classes require that dependencies are passed into class contractors. This is primally to support testing. By avoiding directly import Adafruit Python libraries it allows for running tests with normal CPython by passing in mocks or normal Python versions of the classes. 

### `main.py` vs `code.py`

Most circuit python codebases seem to use `code.py` for the main entrypoint file, however circuit python also accept `main.py` as the main entrypoint file. We use `main.py` because VSCode test plugin hits the following error if we attempt to run tests and `code.py` exists. So we will just work around this and name the entry point file `main.py` instead.

```

### Logging to filesystem

At one point I set this up logging to the file system, see [12639a7](https://github.com/anitschke/childrens-museum-franklin-train-board/commit/12639a794d5604a41d5e1b3bb21851ef8ebe4f4a) but it had issues where logging to the filesystem leads to the LEDs flashing while writing to the file system. I am not sure why, I thought it might be a larger power draw to write to flash and used a better USB power supply but it still flashed. So IDK. I am also a little worried about wearing down the flash storage ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45982155/can-a-high-number-of-read-write-deteriorate-the-flash-itself ). It also adds a lot of extra complexity to the code so I reverted that change.

### Thanks to the MBTA

Thanks to the MBTA for your [excellent API documentation for the V3 API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api), it made this project a lot easier.

### Inspiration

I want to thank Enrique Gamboa for his [Medium article](https://jegamboafuentes.medium.com/i-created-my-own-subway-arrival-board-with-real-time-data-to-dont-miss-my-train-anymore-28bfded312c0) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jegamboafuentes/Train_schedule_board) for a very similar train arrival time board that also used the MBTA API. They served as a major form of inspiration when I was working on this project.
